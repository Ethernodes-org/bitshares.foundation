The BitShares Blockchain Foundation takes a lead in managing worker proposals on
BitShares. Freelancers around the world that want to work for the BitShares DAC
are organized through our trusted escrow setup which carefully vets worker
proposals of freelancers, sets them up on the blockchain and ensures the maximum
of code quality for the BTS token holders.

Given that a worker may be voted in for quite some time, the BitShares
Foundation would like to exercise the new model of running a worker to reduce
risks and costs for the BTS token holders:

* BitShares Blockchain Foundation has an account (`workers.bitshares.foundation`) that is co-owned by `committee-account` and escrow partners.
* The worker will redeem it's funds on a regular basis and buy up bitUSD from the market (with rational premiums).
* For this reasons and due to volatility of BTS, the actual pay of the worker is higher than the USD value.
* The worker will only pay the agreed amount of money and pay only in bitUSD to the `bitshares.foundation` account.
* Every BTS that is not paid out after the end of the worker will be returned to the BTS token holders through the reserve fund.
* In the event a worker is voted out prior to its completion, the pro-rata share of payment will be made to the freelancer and the contract will be closed.

## Legal Setup

Workers listed on this site will be owned by the BitShares Blockchain
Foundation, who will also act as the freelancer's contracting partner, supervise
the progress and facilitate payouts in bitUSD through a multi-signature escrow
setup.

ChainSquad GmbH (@xeroc) has offered to handle the technical details, act as an
escrow and lead quality assurance procedures.

Additional partners of the BitShares Blockchain Foundation may be added to the
multi-signature scheme to strengthen the quality protocols and add additional
expertise.

## Accounting

The the sake of **transparency and accountability**, we have the
accounting for the escrow workers under public domain. You can read
more about this on our dedicated [Accountability Page](/accounting).

# Market fees for bitUSD and bitCNY have been raised

Previously free trading with bitCNY and bitUSD now impose a trading fee
of 0.1% to be paid by the receiving party. This proposal has been
initiated by a committee member and after [some discussion](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26072.0)
has been [approved by most of the committee members](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=26083.0).

## Consequences

As of today, buyers of bitCNY and bitUSD that go through the internal
trading facilities of BitShares need to pay a 0.1% fee on the traded
volume.

title: BitShares/BTS - Terminology
layout: announcement
---

Most public blockchain systems carry a core native token, such as the
BTC on the Bitcoin Blockchain, the ETH or Ether on the Ethereum
blockchain, or XRP on Ripple. But, not so fast. Let's take a look at
what [wikipedia/bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) has to say about it:

```
There is no uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization. Some sources
use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network and
bitcoin, lowercase, to refer to the unit of account.[7] The WSJ[8] and
The Chronicle of Higher Education[9] advocate use of lowercase bitcoin
in all cases, however.
```

and [en.bitcoin.it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Introduction#Capitalization_.2F_Nomenclature)

```
* Since Bitcoin is both a currency and a protocol, capitalization can be
  confusing. Accepted practice is to use Bitcoin (singular with an upper
  case letter B) to label the protocol, software, and community, while

* bitcoins (with a lower case b) to label units of the currency.
```

As you can see, the Bitcoin community has yet to decide on the correct
use of terminology.

However, it is very clear that we need a distinction between the system
that operates a token and the token itself.

## Terminology in BitShares

The purpose of this short article is to clarify the terminology around
the BitShares Blockchain and its core native token BTS as it is used in
[the whitepaper](http://bitshares.foundation/papers/BitSharesBlockchain.pdf).
Although this is widely accepted by the community by now, the
terminology used by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation is a mere
proposal.

We distinguish between

* the **BitShares Blockchain**, and
* the **core native token BTS** (symbol **BTS**).

We do this consistently to distinguish **technology** from **token and economics**.

## This means that

* We use the BitShares Blockchain for transactions.
* BTS stake is used for on-chain governance and voting.
* Transferring BTS requires the owning account on the BitShares
  Blockchain to sign a transaction.
* The pizza should have cost 10,000 BTS.

The operation with id `1.11.147085021` has another batch of 100,000 BTS
being reserved (e.g. given back to the working budget/reserves). As of
today, 420,703.60884 BTS are yet to be reserved with 500,000 BTS already
returned so far.

As usual, our strategy is to reserve those funds in medium-sized chunks
to avoid falsifying weekly statistics.

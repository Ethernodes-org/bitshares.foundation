As it matures, we would like to take the change to further introduce the
BitShares Blockchain Foundation and introduce our idea of a foundation
advisory board to be created in the near future.

# Abstract

The (Stichting) BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) is a non-profit
organization registered in Deventer, Netherlands. It is operational
since June 2016 and has been preparing industries behind the scenes ever
since.  As time goes by, the BitShares Blockchain Foundation would like
to take some time to introduce itself more publicly as well as present
plans for a BTS holder voted advisory board (read on to find out more).

## Mission

The BBF’s mission is to promote, advocate and grow the BitShares
ecosystem. A major aspect is the proper presentation of the platform’s
potential and its decentralized and autonomous community (DAC) in a
variety of ways, including compliance and its legal position. In most
parts of the word, societies, as well as legal frameworks need to find
ways to work with DACs. We see the BitShares blockchain ecosystem
pioneering not only the technological innovations but also social and
regulatory evolution.

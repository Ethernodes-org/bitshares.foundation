Lykke, a Swiss Fintech company building a regulated, blockchain-based global marketplace, and BitShares, a pioneer in decentralized financial exchange technology, have announced plans to implement the BitShares blockchain on the Lykke platform and make the BitShares core asset, the BTS token, available for trade on the Lykke Exchange.

Following the implementation, investors will be able to buy and sell BTS on the Lykke Exchange, alongside other currencies, crypto and fiat. **This listing means a significant expansion for BTS. Lykke UK Exchange considers to offer a number of pairs, such as BTS-BTC, BTS-EUR and BTS-USD.**

*“We are delighted to be partnering with BitShares Blockchain Foundation”*, said Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO. *“Innovative ideas for a fast, decentralized, scalable exchange that actively promotes price-stable conditions will undoubtedly shape the future of our industry.”*

To clarify on the term *partnership*: Lykke has asked the BBF to provide factually correct details about BTS as a utility token for their legal council to approve a listing. Being elected spokesperson, the BBF provides these information and assisted their lawyers to come to a positive conclusion.

Fabian Schuh, CTO, and Annemieke Dirkes, CEO at BlockchainProjects BV and the official spokesperson for the BitShares Blockchain Foundation, are looking forward to bring the collaboration with Lykke to a success. *“A great opportunity for BTS holders! The collaboration with the entire Lykke team is off to a great start, and we all look forward to the listing,”* said Dirkes.

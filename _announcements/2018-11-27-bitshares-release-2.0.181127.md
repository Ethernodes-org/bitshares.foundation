Dear BitShares User and Business Partners,

due to an overflow bug in bitshares-core, the block production
has automatically halted. The issue has been identified by our
core development team and was fixed shortly after.
A corresponding patch has been merged and a new
[new release version](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/releases/latest)

    2.0.181127

has been tagged.

This is a **consensus changing protocol upgrade**. All full nodes MUST upgrade.

If you are using the official docker container, please allow some
time for the container to be built by the docker cloud.

We would like to reassure that:
* No fund have been at a risk
* There were no forks

## Mailing Lists

We would like to remind everyone of the [mailing
lists](http://lists.bitshares.foundation/listinfo) operated by the BitShares
Blockchain Foundation where business operators and users can engage discussions
and get the most recent updates, directly. An distinct mailing list for
*critical* operation updates exists, too.

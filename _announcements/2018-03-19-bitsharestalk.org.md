know that it has accquired ownership of
[BitSharesTalk.org](https:/bitsharestalk.org) from
[Bitsapphire](https://bitsapphire.com/) and will gladly continue to
provide the forums as a platform for communications to the entire
community.

BitSharesTalk.org contains an historical archive of the development the
BitShares Blockchain and is considered an integral part of the entire
ecosystem and provides a platform to support the on-chain governance

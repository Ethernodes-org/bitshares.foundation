---

We'd like to take the opportunity to remind every node operator, exchange partner, 3rd party business, or block producer operating on BitShares, that there is a new release of the [BitShares back-end](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/releases/latest) software that adds additional features to the protocol.

This is a **consensus changing protocol upgrade**. All full nodes **MUST** upgrade before

        2017-12-08 15:40:00 UTC!

The most recent version is `2.0.171105a` and has been tested thoroughly during the last 4 weeks.

A full list of changes can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/releases/latest) of in our [previous announcement](http://www.bitshares.foundation/announcements/2017-10-30-bitshares-backend-update) from October 30th.

If you are a regular front-end user, this update does not affect you.

## Mailing Lists

We would like to remind everyone of the [mailing lists](http://lists.bitshares.foundation/listinfo) operated by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation where business operators and users can engage discussions and get the most recent updates, directly. An distinct mailing list for *critical* operation updates exists, too.

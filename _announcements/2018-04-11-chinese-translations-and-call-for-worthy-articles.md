The [budget worker for chinese translation](/workers/2018-01-budget-chinese-translations) is active and the BitShares Blockchain Foundations website 
now supports multi-lingual articles. The first one to be translated is the "Crypto-Currencies as Medium of Payment" article
([english version](/articles/2017-11-29-crypto-as-payment), 
[chinese version](/articles/2017-11-29-crypto-as-payment-cn)).

We are happy the community recognized our efforts to provide budget for translations and are calling herewith out to 
the community to point us to interesting articles that are then to be considered for translation. Additionally, if you 
are a translator and would like to be considered for work, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@bitshares.foundation">info@bitshares.foundation</a>, or tag us in Steem (@bitshares.fdn).

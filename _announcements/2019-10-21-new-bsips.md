Dear reader,

as you know, the governance system of BitShares requires new features to be
approved by BTS holders. In the last months, the developers and the community
have put together multiple BitShares Improvement Proposals (BSIPs) of which,
the following 13 are ready for voting:

* [BSIP 73: Match force-settlement orders with margin calls and limit orders](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip73)
* [BSIP 72: Tanks and Taps: A General Solution for Smart Contract Asset Handling](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip72)
* [BSIP 71: Prevent Global Settlement and External Attacks](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip71)
* [BSIP 70: Peer-to-Peer Leveraged Trading](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip70)
* [BSIP 69: Additional Assert Predicates](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip69)

* [BSIP 61: Operation to Update Limit Orders](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip61)
* [BSIP 57: Managed Vesting Balances](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-01-bsip57)
* [BSIP 47: Vote Proxies for Different Referendum Categories and explicit voting operation](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip47)
* [BSIP 45: Add BitAsset as Backing Collateral flag/permission](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip45)
* [BSIP 39: Automatically approve proposals by the proposer](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip39)
* [BSIP 22: Vote Decay for Witnesses, Committee members & Proxies](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-10-bsip22)

Please review these proposals (they all come with a short summary) and
make a decision on each of them if you support that particular change.

At this point, we would like to emphasize that the BBF does not
participate in governance processes, has no opinion on any of these
proposals, stays neutral with respect to all aspects of on-chain
governance.

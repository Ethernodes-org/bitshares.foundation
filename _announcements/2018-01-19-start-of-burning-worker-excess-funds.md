layout: announcement

As per the promise for managing escrow operations for workers and
freelancers on behalf of the BitShares Blockchain and in correspondence
with our recent [accounting report](/announcements/2018-01-16-worker-accounting-report),
we have started **giving back excess funds** from the workers we have
managed so far.

The operation with id `1.11.120681976` is our first batch of 150,000 BTS
being reserved (e.g. given back to the working budget/reserves). As of
today, 782,339.68910 BTS are yet to be reserved. Our current strategy is
to reserve those funds in medium-sized chunks to avoid falsifying weekly
statistics.

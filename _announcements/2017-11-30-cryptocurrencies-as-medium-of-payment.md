The BitShares Blockchain Foundation is pleased to announce a new paper
that compares the commonly used concepts of achieving *price-stable*
crypto-currencies. The paper was written as an entry-point for
interested readers to understand the basic aspects. With this, we hope
to clarify the differences, individual risks and opportunities for
price-stable crypto-currencies in the blockchain space.

# Abstract

With the current growth of the crypto-ecosystem in general, and the
growth of crypto-currencies like BTC (Bitcoin Blockchain) and ETH
(Ethereum Blockchain) in particular, the general public as well as
traditional (old economy) markets finally take notice of blockchain
technology and its application(s) in the financial technology and other
sectors.

A well-known obstacle to greater adoption of crypto-currencies like BTC
as a **medium of payment** is the high volatility of its exchange value,
due to its limited supply. As a consequence, the unit price varies
(sometimes significantly) over short periods of time. This makes BTC
unpractical for merchants that need to pay their suppliers in cash -
especially in bearish markets where this currency risk can ruin a
business.

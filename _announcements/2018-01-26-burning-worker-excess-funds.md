The operation with id `1.11.125087527` has another batch of 150,000 BTS
being reserved (e.g. given back to the working budget/reserves). As of
today, 482,339.68910 BTS are yet to be reserved. Our current strategy is
to reserve those funds in medium-sized chunks to avoid falsifying weekly
statistics.

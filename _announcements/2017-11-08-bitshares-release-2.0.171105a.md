title: BitShares Core Release 2.0.171105a
layout: announcement
---

Dear BitShares User and Business Partners,

we would like to iterate over the [previous announcement](http://lists.bitshares.foundation/pipermail/announcements/2017-October/000007.html) from October 30th, and
inform you of a minor release update that improves stability prior to the
protocol upgrade date. If you are a regular front-end user, this update does not
affect you.

Additionally, after some discussions within the core development team, a decision
has been made to slightly postpone the deadline at which all back-end nodes need to
have upgraded to the [new release version](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/releases/tag/2.0.171105a) tagged with

        2.0.171105a

This is a **consensus changing protocol upgrade**. All full nodes MUST upgrade before

        2017-12-08 15:40:00 UTC!

A detailed description of the changes introduced by this update can be [found here](http://www.bitshares.foundation/announcements/2017-10-30-bitshares-backend-update).

## Mailing Lists

We would like to remind everyone of the [mailing
lists](http://lists.bitshares.foundation/listinfo) operated by the BitShares
Blockchain Foundation where business operators and users can engage discussions
and get the most recent updates, directly. An distinct mailing list for
*critical* operation updates exists, too.

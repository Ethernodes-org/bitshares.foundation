The BitShares Blockchain Foundation is please to let everyone know that a few
days ago, the BitShares Committee, consisting of approved members of the
BitShares Blockchain Ecosystem, has been invited to form the **Advisory Board**
of the BitShares Blockchain Foundation.

This step is our moral obligation to connect to the entire BitShares Blockchain
in the best way possible and be able to serve the ecosystem best.

[Invitation Letter]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/articles/20180319_Invitation_to_the_Committee.pdf)

The invitation letter, of course, needs to be publicly accepted by a majority
of the members of the BitShares Committee. We hope to see this happening in the
next few days and are looking to work together with the Committee even more
closely.

# Spokesperson

In [October 18th '17](/announcements/2017-10-18-bbf-elected-as-spokesperson),
the *BitShares Blockchain Foundation* has been elected as official and sole 
**spokesperson** and **public face** of BitShares and has acted as such until the 
end of 2018 when the corresponding worker expired. In the beginning of 2019
was re-elected to be the sole **legal representative** for the BitShares Blockchain
until the end of 2019. The continued support and trust from the community is 
much appreciated.

*Remark 1*: The scope of the 2019 worker in comparison to the 2018 worker was 
reduced to focus on the key aspects of legal issues and to allow for other 
entities to step up as a public face of the BitShares Blockchain.

*Remark 2*:
The nomination as spokesperson arose in response to the turmoil around
BitShares not having an entity that represents it in the public - in
particular in discussions with exchanges, on-/off-ramps and third party
businesses looking to integrate with the BitShares Blockchain.

## The Mandate

To address these difficulties that come with being a DAC, the BitShares
Blockchain Foundation proposed to function as the 
**sole legal representative** for the BitShares in external communication 
regarding legal matters.

The approval of the proposal by the BTS holders resulted in a mandate
that will be active until the end of 2019. Being appointed as an 
official representative highlights BitShares'
**technical strength** and **governance process** of this unique
decentralized and autonomous community (DAC). 

## Limitations of the Mandate

We would like to emphasize that this mandate does **not** allow us to
guide the future of the BitShares Blockchain. If we see need for further
approval of actions by BTS holders or to make changes to the underlying
protocol, **separate proposals** will need to undergo the scrutiny of the
BTS holders by means of approval voting.

## Invitation and Contact

Furthermore, we would like to encourage everyone interested in meeting
the people behind the BitShares Blockchain Foundation to make an
appointment via [email](mailto:spokesperson@bitshares.foundation).

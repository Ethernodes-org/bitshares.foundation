# Introduction

Dear BitShares Stakeholders and valuable committee members, 

**Thank you BitShares Foundation for giving me the opportunity to
request a small sponsorship worker for the SteemFest 24 hour hackathon
to be held as a part of SteemFest² in Lisbon, on November 1st 2017 in
Cowork Lisboa.**

**SteemFest Hackathon:** _a developer oriented event focussing on
creating proof of concept apps for Graphene-based blockchains._

During the course of 24 hours about 60 (or more) developers, designers
and strategists are invited to work on a proof of concept app, to be
demo-ed at Conference Day 2 of SteemFest. The idea for this hackathon is
to draw new talent towards blockchain development and to introduce them
to the development tools and possibilities. By having bright minds
coming together and work on something new, the versatility of the chains
can be explored and exposed. 

## SteemFest²: 1/2/3/4/5 November, Lisbon

[SteemFest](https://steemfest.com) is the annual get together focussed
on bringing steem users together in real life to learn from eachother
and have a good time. Both conference days are filled with
presentations, workshops and panels for steem users, by steem users. At
nights some social events are happening and in the weekend attendees
have ample time to explore the city, tourist wise :P - Steemit has
become the defacto standard blogging tool for (graphene based)
blockchain announcements and for example witness announcements of all
sorts. Many Steem users know of BitShares and use it, but there is still
work to be done. Did you know that this year you can also buy your
SteemFest ticket with BTS? 

SteemFest's main event and program is still in the works but amongst the
2017 speakers who are already confirmed, of whom some of them will also
be present at the hackathon (if relevant / devs) are: 
- Steemit's CEO Ned Scott
- Steemit's CTO Jeffrey Paul
- Jaxx CTO Charlie Shrem
- Author & Economist William Mougayar
- Anarcho-capitalist Jeff Berwick

See https://steemfest.com for the complete list of announced speakers. 

## Organisation's Experience: 

SteemFest hackathon as part of SteemFest is organised by @roelandp with
help from a group of enthusiast supporters during the event days. My
experience in events is imho considerable: being co-organiser of
TodaysArt.org for 5 years (3 years fulltime, 2 years parttime) and 2
Music Hackathon Amsterdam events and 3 Liberty Global 'Appathons' (and
ofcourse organising SteemFest [last year](https://steemfest.salon.io))
gives me quite the experience in organising events.

# 'Focus Chain'-Sponsoring at the SteemFest² Hackathon 2017:

Next to the big prize to paid out in steem for the best overall hack we
would like to have a couple of graphene-based **Focus Chains** who have
**their own prize** and judging criteria. We have currently asked a
couple of other graphene chains such as Steem (will sponsor), Decent,
Peerplays and Muse to join in as Focus Chain sponsors. Idea behind being
a Focus Chain is on one hand that the chain is getting additional
attention on the main SteemFest conference and that developers _might_ opt to pick
that chain to build a new app for (no guarantees, developers are free to
make whatever app they want). 

To join the sponsoring and become a **focus chain**, the organizers are
asking for **5555 bitUSD** and an **additional 1111 bitUSD as prize
money**.
 
This sponsorship through a worker would give BitShares: 

1. A chance to attract new developers to BitShares by:
 - having an **introductionary (dev oriented) talk** in the morning of the hackathon
 - being a Focus Chain sponsor on **all printed matters and SteemFest related materials** 
 - having **developers making apps for the BitShares chain**, presenting them on the main SteemFest
2. A chance to attract new users to BitShares by:
 - getting a **20 minute presentation slot at main SteemFest event** on one of the conference days.

## Usage of Sponsorship Money:
The sponsorship money will be distributed and use for the following items:
- For the marketing of the hackathon: site and promotion. 
- For a pre-drinks event the evening before the hackathon starts at a to be defined location in Lisboa. 
- For the organisation of the hackathon: venue rental, internet,
  audiovisual, catering for the attendees (24 hour catering consists of:
  beverages & snacks all day, lunch, dinner, breakfast in the morning)
- For the main SteemFest event as attendees of the hackathon who will be presenting their works on the
  main event (day 2) and will join for dinner & nighttime drinks. 

## Usage of Prize Money:

- Prize handed out to developers for building an app on BitShares
- If no apps are built for BitShares the 1111 bitUSD prizemoney are not
  released and handed back to the BitShares shareholders.

# Blockchain Academy - Marketing BitShares through education 

## Who is the Blockchain Academy?
The Blockchain Academy is a non-profit organization; founded by two
teachers from [Saxion University](https://www.saxion.edu) (Netherlands).

## Achievements
To familiarize students and professors with the possibilities of the
BitShares Blockchain, the Blockchain Academy (BA), has in the past
already launched an education program (at their own expenses) and made a
pilot [available to Dutch students and
professors](https://blockchainacademy.nl/). [See press
release](https://steemit.com/bitshares/@bitshares.fdn/we-launch-the-blockchain-academy).
Possible next rounds will include English and German taught programs to
be rolled out.

## Achievements so far
* 12 graduate assignments
* 2 classes in two city's with total 60 students

## Problem & Opportunity
In general, public universities do not have an abundance of financial
funds to create materials and hire us for help. We, on the other hand,
are committed to improve the strength of the BitShares network, and
create a group of future ambassadors, users and programmers of the
network via the means of education and support.

## Consideration
Currently, many universities are searching for educational course
materials on the blockchain and cryptocurrencies for the upcoming year.
This is an opportunity for BitShares. Through the Blockchain Academy,
we can direct their attention towards the BitShares blockchain and
prevent that they choose another (competitor) blockchain as the basis of
their curriculum. 

## Proposal
We propose to expand the material available from BitShares.org and our
alliances with educational centres. We will create additional
educational material in Dutch in the form of assignments, an exam,
website and workshop presentations to support the BA initiative. Besides
that, we will also introduce the [BitShares
Testnet](https://testnet.bitshares.eu/) to the university and provide
guidance in exploring the functionalities of the Testnet.

Furthermore, education program offered by the Blockchain Academy will
reduce the cost- and knowledge-based barrier to introduce blockchain
courses at universities by offering ready-to-use materials along with
supportive guidance at reasonable cost. 

## Milestones
* Translation of the website from Dutch to English and German
* At least 3 universities sign up for the education program of the Blockchain Academy
* At least 3 universities will adopt the BitShares Testnet
* Training of 3 faculty's
* Monthly project update on Steemit

## Budget 
We ask to fund a total of **15.000 USD** for the development of
additional educational materials, providing introduction workshops,
explaining professors & students how the Testnet works, help-desk
support and travelling costs.

You can expect from us that all educational materials will be
**finalized at the 31st of March 2018** and will be free available
through the [Blockchain Academy website](https://blockchainacademy.nl/). 

The 15.000 USD is payable from December 2017 through April 2018. Monthly
invoices of 3.000 USD each will be provided publicly.   

## Scope
Also we will contact 30 Dutch universities offering studies to students
of Business Administration and/or Information and Communications
Technology.

## Future Opportunities
After improving the educational materials, we aim to reach at least an
additional 2.000 students in the Dutch (the Netherlands and Belgium),
English (UK) and German (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) speaking
regions. Of this, we estimate approximately 1.500 students to register
an account on the BitShares network. Furthermore, the education program
offered by the BA will reduce the costs- and knowledge-based barrier to
introduce blockchain courses by offering ready-to-use materials along
with supportive guidance at reasonable costs.

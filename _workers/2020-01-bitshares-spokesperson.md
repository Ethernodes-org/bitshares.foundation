# Introduction

The strength of BitShares is that of its technical superiority, but by
nature of its decentralized and autonomous community organization all
the rest is not continuously attended unlike in most other platforms.

> In a decentralized ecosystem, we are not looking for leaders or owners,
> but we are looking for leadership.

The lack of centralized leadership comes with undesirable effects. There is no
one following a bigger picture, not business development, public relations, or even marketing.

The BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) is tightly connected to the BitShares community and has been
operating escrow services, and generally been available for the BitShares community and for
businesses all over the world as a point of contact.

Many of the incoming requests and opportunities that present itself within the extensive network
that the BitShares Blockchain Foundation has built over the years need tending, follow ups, research
and simply put: effort hours to deal with.

The aim of this worker proposal is to provide a budget in order to get back on track and
present the BBF as point of contact for business inquiries regarding the BitShares blockchain
as a platform. This is not meant as an exclusive point of contact.

# Proposal

We here propose to appoint The BitShares Blockchain Foundation, a
legally based, Chamber of Commerce registered entity under Dutch Law, to
re-engage in external communication as a **spokesperson** for BitShares,
to coordinate and distribute work and to act as business representative.

With the support of the BitShares holders, we suggest this becomes again a
**public face of BitShares**.

As long as this worker is approved, we feel obligated to represent
BitShares publicly in the best interest of its token holders. BTS
holders keep their freedom to terminate this proposal at any time.

# Remark

*There may be several spokesperson for the BitShares Blockchain, this is in contrast to
the legal representative, which has to be the sole one.

# Mission

Our mission is to

* grow the global recognition of BitShares as a financial technologies
  platform
* forward worker proposals to increase marketing and technology
* partner with businesses that are already growing within and outside of
  the Graphene-family
* provide intermediate business development for BitShares when opportunities arise

# Fee

Everyone's time is valuable. As such, we are asking for funding though the BitShares Blockchain Reserves and seek a fixed
monthly fee of 2000 EUR for the next 12 months,
payable from January 1st 2020 until December 31st 2020. Invoices will be provided publicly through the
[accounting website](https://workers.bitshares.foundation/).
The fee only covers the hours spent by the entire team to subjects related only to this spokesperson role. Travel expenses or
fees of 3rd parties
are not included, and need to be funded separately. The payment of this fee will happen preferably in bitEUR, but may also
happen in any alternative BitAsset,
BTS directly, or in BTC depending on market conditions. The value indicated here and on later invoices represent FIAT values,
and will be paid in equivalent value of the chosen crypto-currency. This worker carries no escrow fee.

The daily BTS payout is set to 14.723 BTS, which contains a devaluation multiplier of 3. In theory, if the price remains the same and the worker
is voted active, it will take 4 months to collect the budget for the whole year.

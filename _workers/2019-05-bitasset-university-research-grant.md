# Highlights

### **Matching Agreement** with the funds from this **Colorado state blockchain bill**!

The deal would be a 1-to-3 Colorado-BitShares match, with Colorado
contributing up to $50,000. So this means if BitShares contributes
$150,000, we’ll get $50,000 out of the state funds for a nice $200,000
overall deal. If you contribute $120k, we'll get $40k from the state. My
chair verbally authorized me to proceed with this, but of course there
is still paperwork left to file as we continue to move forward.

### Budget

Here are some actual budget numbers so you can see what we’re talking
about. All include the 10% gift tax.

* PhD Student annual salary: **$26,736**
* PhD student annual tuition (9 credits per semester): **$14,495.56**
* Dr. Brown month of summer salary: **$14,354.44**
* Dr. Brown 1-course teaching load reduction: **$12,919.00**

# Budget Restrictions

Worker funds are release relatively slowly, so an extremely aggressive
timeline may not be possible. However, the BitShares Committee has
access to additional funds that could be loaned temporarily by this
worker and paid back over time to cover the full amount relatively early
and allow commitment for a 2 year-long research grant for BitShares.

The committment will be accepted by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation
as partner for the University of Colorado **only** in the case the funds
are available in total to the foundation.

Hence, in case this worker is approved, we will seek out to the
committee to "loan" BTS to secure the committement from funds available to
them. However, the "loan" can and will only be paid back from funds
received by this worker. In case the worker does not obtain sufficient
funds, the loan will not be paid back in full.

# Executive summary

Prof. Philip Brown wrote an executive summary that contains the full
details of the PhD student to work on.

**Key Research Thrusts**:

* Recommend concrete improvements to the Bitshares MPA system
* Develop a “science of stablecoins,” investigating the key design tradeoffs in the space.
  * Can the balance between short-term and long-term stability be tuned ?
  * Is there a fundamental tradeoff in stablecoins between manipulability and short-term stability?
  * How can we assess risk in stablecoin systems, taking into account the incentives seen by all parties?

**Additional project activities**:
1. Travel to universities and academic/blockchain conferences to present our research.
2. Participation and outreach in blockchain community events in the greater Colorado Springs area.

# Summary

The proposed research grant funds an exciting and ambitious undertaking,
as it promises both technical results relevant to the functioning of the
BitShares DAC as well as basic science which will advance knowledge and
lead to visibility and lasting impact in the broader academic community.

It is our hope that in its success, this project will accomplish the
following three unique things:

1. Bring new tools and theory to bear on the practical challenges faced by the Bitshares DAC,
2. Spread awareness of the Bitshares ecosystem to a previously unreached audience, and
3. Showcase the Bitshares community’s ability and commitment to fund
   higher learning projects which confer benefits beyond the insular
   setting of Bitshares itself.

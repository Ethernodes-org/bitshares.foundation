# Introduction

The strength of the BitShares Blockchain is its technical superiority and distributed governance. However, due to its decentralized and autonomous nature, some aspects are not continuously attended in comparison to most other blockchain platforms. One of those aspects is marketing. Everyone wants it, but it is hard to find a spearhead for it. We aim to change that by doing baby steps and are asking for funding to conduct interviews, craft articles and increase the general visibility and awareness of the BitShares Blockchain by fixing misinformation and deadlinks in common crypto-overview websites and centralized exchanges.

This worker proposal is intentionally kept small, and if successful will be followed up on.

# General frame

We (Blockchain Projects BV, BCP) propose that we engage on behalf of the community and organize the direct communication to external entities with regards to the marketing efforts listed below. This worker proposal intends to pay by the hour according to the task at hand and provide a budget to pay posting fees and similar. Any member of the BitShares community can approach us and help with any of the listed marketing efforts and receive the associated payment, the selection of who to assign to which task remains within our own discretion. Any publication material will be reviewed by us with respect to facts of the BitShares Blockchain.

# Marketing efforts

## Interviews

There are numerous online magazines and other channels out there that are featuring blockchains. We aim to contact them on
behalf of the BitShares community, discuss possibilities and organize the actual execution of the interview which results in
a publication within the magazine / channel. This typically includes a feature fee and hourly costs to actually conduct the
interview and spread the word about the publication afterwards.

## Articles

There is lack of professional content with respect to the BitShares Blockchain. Efforts here will include to craft articles
and get them posted in magazines or other channels. Topics can include general overview of the BitShares Blockchain,
statistics, educational content and more in-depth articles of specific features and business models enabled by the BitShares 
Blockchain. This typically includes a publication fee and hourly costs to actually write the article and spread the word 
about the publication afterwards.

## Visibility

There are again and again articles popping up in the context of DEX, stable-coins or other subjects that the BitShares 
Blockchain would be considered among the pioneering blockchains. Additionally, there are crypto-overview websites and
centralized exchanges that give short overviews over tokens and blockchains, and are either lacking the BitShares
Blockchain / BTS or have misinformation. Efforts here will include approaching them on behalf of the BitShares community
and give insight, request correction or simply to spread the word. A simply ping is not enough, so this will require
more aggressive form of communication and continued follow ups. This can include various online media, including
social ones and is typically done on hourly basis for content creation, corrections and communication with the other party.

# Measurables

The following are tangible points that this worker proposal will pursue.
All **fees** are fixed costs, which are paid to the respective entity for the publication, whereas **budget** work is done 
on an *hourly* basis. The amount indicated with those budgets reflects the total budget that is allowed to be 
spent on hourly rates. Billing will happen for actually incurred hours only and we will strive to find best 
cost-value ratios in the hourly rates. The budget is meant as "up to", and if we can get it done for less, we will do so. Nevertheless, we ask the community to allow us flexibility in the hourly rates
to accomodate freelancers with different backgrounds and qualifications, depending on the task. The maximum hourly rate is
capped and listed in the budget section.

In case one of the publications does not follow through, we reserve the right to redirect the respective marketing effort
to an alternative magazine / channel that we find an appropriate replacement. Assumption is 6,79 CNY / USD. Furhermore,
if the budget allows due to efficient time management, we may select additional interviews, articles and visibility
efforts to execute.

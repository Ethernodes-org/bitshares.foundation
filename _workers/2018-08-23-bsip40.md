This BSIP proposal is asking for compensation of the hours spent birthing, formulating, specifying and reviewing it. Total hours spent are
 - Stefan Schie√ül, @sschiessl-bcp, 18
 - Fabian Schuh, @xeroc, 3
 - Alex Megalokonomos, @clockworkgr, 2
 - @abitmore (covered by core worker)
 - Peter Conrad (covered by core worker)

Assuming 150 USD per hour, this is summing up to 3450 bitUSD. All unused BTS will be returned.

# **Worker Proposal**

Given the growth of the BitShares ecosystem, we ([Blockchain Projects BV](http://blockchainprojectsbv.com/)) have been providing a basic infrastructure with the former and soon to expire infrastructure worker (reports can be [found here](http://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2018-07-infrastructure)). The community has been contributing as well and the number of nodes for the reference wallet has been kept at a healthy amount.

That said, we would like to continue to provide the nodes that have been deployed with the last worker. The reference faucet has been moved to [its own worker](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-02-reference-faucet).

## **Distributed Network of BitShares nodes**

The core component of this proposal is the distribution of the BitShares network by means of deploying multiple nodes and offer public API endpoints to improve latency, robustness and availability for the BitShares ecosystem. Since this proposal is funded by the BitShares ecosystem, we limit the use of the APIs to non-commercial activity.

### **Distributed Network for Mainnet Nodes**

The three deployed BitShares nodes

	eu.nodes.bitshares.ws
	us.nodes.bitshares.ws
	sg.nodes.bitshares.ws

will be continuously operated within the description of the last worker.

### **Distributed Network for Testnet Nodes**

The deployed BitShares testnet node

	testnet.nodes.bitshares.ws

will be continuously operated within the description of the last worker. If necessary, additional testnet nodes will be deployed.

### **Public Uptime Tracking**

Next to the status page of the load balancers, we intend to either add the nodes above to an existing uptime logging service or deploy our own. This will greatly improve transparency to the BTS holders and voters to see uptime and availability.

### **Maintenance of Automation of Docker Container Builds**

The **automated builds** using docker containers will continue to be available and maintained. These containers allow a very easy and fast deployment of BitShares nodes. The automation docker cloud ensures that the public sources of BitShares-core on Github are compiled in a transparent way, additionally, the inclusion of further nodes will be greatly facilitated.

During the last worker proposal, we have also managed automated builds for the BitShares testnet as well as for release **tags** and **pull requests** of the entire repository.

## **Elasticsearch BitShares nodes for public use**

Advanced features of the reference wallet require full history and advanced searching capabilities to function smoothly, which requires publicly available nodes with Elasticsearch support. This worker continues to provide a ES cluster that is accessible at

    https://elasticsearch.bitshares.ws (direct ES access, http authentification BitShares:Infrastructure)
    https://wrapper.elasticsearch.bitshares.ws (python wrapper)
    https://wrapper.elasticsearch.bitshares.ws/apidocs/ (python wrapper docs)

This will greatly simplify the workflow of developers and business administration for BitShares and enable easy access to statistical data processing and charting. Since the Elastic Search plugin from the bitshares-core is now stable, this will be used more extensively in the future.

# **Milestones**

1. Maintain deployed infrastructure 
2. Maintain ES cluster deployment
3. Maintain ES wrapper deployment
4. Monitoring

As time progresses, more nodes will be added in the most economical manner.

# **Payment**

Operating the nodes:

* **USD (Fee):** Maintenance fee - **1,650 USD/month**
* **USD (Expense):** Payment of the server costs (Hetzner, EC2, Google Cloud, â€¦) - starting at **100 USD/month/server**
* **USD (Expense):** Cost for obtaining premium SSL certificates, estimated at **50 USD/domain**

As you can see, we distinguish between fees and expenses. Note that while the total fees are fixed (13,860 USD) for the whole duration of the worker proposal, the expenses (approx. 19,000 USD) may change depending on network growth, server availability and actual hours spent on a task. Obviously, as the BitShares network grows, we expect growth of share price which allows this worker to obtain new servers to match bandwidth demands.

The BitShares Blockchain Foundation runs the escrow operations and earns 5% of the overall fees to cover their own expenses. Of course, our escrow partner will **publish invoices immediately**.

# **Cost Overview**

The total costs are summarized again (marked with ~ where estimated expense)

          12 * 1,000 USD     (node maintenance fee)
     + 12 * 10 * 100 USD ~   (node server costs)
     ===============================================
     =        24,000 USD     (163,000 CNY)


Thus, we are asking for **163,000 CNY** for the next 12 months and keep the option to add additional servers as we grow and if economically useful. Please note that this amount includes variable cost (expenses) for servers and actual hours and for those only actual expenses will be billed.

# **Key Performance Indicator (KPI)**

The KPIs from the last worker still apply

* Availability and latency of load balanced public API servers
* Availability of Elasticsearch access

If after 12 months, the BTS holders consider this worker a success, we intend to extend our efforts with another worker proposal to keep the deployed infrastructure up and running.

# **Remark**

* Terms & Conditions of Blockchain Projects BV apply with the BitShares DAC being referred to as Client

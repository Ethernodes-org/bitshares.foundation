# Introduction

The strength of BitShares is that of its technical superiority, but by
nature of its decentralized and autonomous community organization all
the rest is not continuously attended unlike in most other platforms.
Over the last week, this created a major problem for our community.

> In a decentralized ecosystem, we are not looking for leaders or owners,
> but we are looking for leadership.

The strength of BitShares is that of technical superiority, and
distributed governance, but by nature of its decentralized and
autonomous community organization all the rest is not continuously
attended unlike in most other platforms. In some areas now with very
undesirable effects. There is no one following a bigger picture, not
business development, public relations, or even marketing. This needs to
change.

Our team is based throughout Europe and has two bodies in the shape of
Foundations:

* **BitShares Foundation**, that deals with eduction sessions on request
  and Escrow services and 
* **BitShares Blockchain Foundation**, that deals with processing worker
  proposals and technical aspects of the platform, as well as keeping in
  touch with broader community.

In order to grow strength and gain sufficient traction several things
need to change. All we need in order to do so is the support of the
BitShares holders. 

# Proposal

We here propose to appoint the *BitShares Blockchain Foundation*, a
legally based, Chamber of Commerce registered entity under Dutch Law, to
engage in external communication as the **only spokesperson** with the
authorities, market parties and legal council. To coordinate and
distribute work and to act as representative. If need be the foundation
may sign on behalf of the community when it is a document that protects
its interests in registration or public tradability. 

With the support of the BitShares holders, we suggest this becomes the
**public face of BitShares**.

As long as this worker is approved, we feel obligated to represent
BitShares publicly in the best interest of its token holders. BTS
holders keep their freedom to terminate this proposal at any time.

#### Remark

*There can be only one representative for the BitShares blockchain, as
otherwise other parties will use this to disqualify all. This is one of
the mayor obstacles right now. We have no options here. Authorities have
a need for one channel. Cryptonomex has already declared not to have
this position or to want to step forward in these matters to sign on
behalf of the community. Its role will be clear through a legal
acceptable document that it is not a party to represent the community in
this. Leaving loose ends here jeopardizes us all*

# Mission

Our mission is to 

* grow the global recognition of BitShares as a financial technologies
  platform
* forward worker proposals to increase marketing and technology
* guide further development of the BitShares core backend
* introduce new features to the platform
* partner with businesses that are already growing within and outside of
  the Graphene-family

# Budget

We are asking for ongoing funding though the BitShares Blockchain
Reserves and seek a **budget of 50,000 bitUSD for the next 15 months**,
payable from October 10th 2017 until December 31st 2018. Monthly
invoices will be provided publicly.

# What to expect from us

* public announcements and press releases
* event organizations (separately funded)
* intermediate business development for BitShares

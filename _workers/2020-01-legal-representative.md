## Global voted Spokesperson and BitShares Legal Representative

The worker "Publicly Approved BitShares Representative"
(https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-01-legal-representative) will be running out
end of this year. The BitShares Blockchain Foundation seeks to renew that mandate with this proposal, and seeks
to additionally introduce an angle for business to business development through the role of being a spokesperson
for the BitShares Blockchain.

In a Business environment dealing with outside communications, legal handling and ultimately signatures a natural person
is required. Experience also shows that direct face-to-face contact (in the real world, or via Skype) with Business
partners is still the most efficient way of communcation. The BBF wants to provide such an environemnt for the
BitShares Blockchain.

For the purpose of distinction between handling legal issues and business to business development, the two tasks are presented separately, each with their own worker. This allows the community to decide which tasks, if any, the BitShares Blockchain Foundation should tackle. Please find more details in the respective addendums below

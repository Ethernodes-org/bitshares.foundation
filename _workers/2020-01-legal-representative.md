## Global voted Spokesperson and BitShares Legal Representative

The worker "Publicly Approved BitShares Representative" (https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-01-legal-representative) will be running out
end of this year. This proposal seeks to renew this mandate, and to introduce business to business development through the role of being a spokesperson
for the BitShares Blockchain.

For the purpose of distinction between the two tasks they are presented separately, each with their own worker, such that the community can decide, if any, which tasks
the BitShares Blockchain Foundation should tackle. Please find more details in the respective addendums below

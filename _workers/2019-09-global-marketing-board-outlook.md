# Vote of No Confidence

Anyone from the community can call for a vote of no confidence. This can be either to shutdown the whole worker, remove or replace specific appointees or to veto a specific effort being made that is not approved yet (in the latter the call must be publicly in the GitHub issue and before the effort is being approved). In case there is a call of no confidence being done, all non-approved efforts are considered halted. All already approved efforts are still considered approved. Every call must be backed with facts and proof of why the call is being made, and it must be backed by at least 20% of the voting power of the current threshold of being active (cryptographic proof of the backing is necessary). For example, a Vote of No Confidence can be made as a poll with two worker proposals (yes or no option), and it would be considered confirmed if the yes worker proposal carries more votes than the threshold, and the no worker proposal for a consecutive week. Anyone can create such poll worker proposals, nevertheless the BitShares Blockchain Foundation may be asked to do so as it is also the final judge in the validity of a Vote of No Confidence call, and it will honor the outcome.

# Summary to the Shareholders

After the preceding worker we approach our marketing venture with guidelines and key goals while not having pre-defined milestones in order to be flexible in the actually spendings and allow for swift decisions. This requires the confidence of the community in the marketing board that this worker seeks to establish. In order to address any centralization concerns this worker contains the possibility to call for a Vote of No Confidence which gives the community the ultimate power for intervention.

We certainly hope to inspire community engagement and thus this worker is intentionally inclusive to facilitate community participation, while any and all content created through this worker will be reviewed and fact-checked by an experienced team before publication. This increases the costs, but it is necessary to create high quality content and fight the existing misinformation on the BitShares Blockchain that currently exists.

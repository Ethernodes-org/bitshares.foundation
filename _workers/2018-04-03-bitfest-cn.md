## 概述
目前，我们正在积极筹划，以准备举办一次石墨烯、BitShares和区块链爱好者的国际会议。此次会议拟命名为比特集会（BitFest），计划于2018年9月21日至23日在阿姆斯特丹举行。会议的目的旨在促进BitShares社区的融合、协作和交流。这将是委员会成员、代理选民、目击者、BitShares核心团队和BitShares区块链基金会以及这一秘密社区的爱好者们共同参加的一次盛会。此外，会上还将安排振奋人心的演讲和创业推介会，并顺带介绍阿姆斯特丹这座城市的美食以及休闲娱乐项目。我们希望此次会议能创造一种温馨的个人氛围，因此计划将参与人数控制在250-300人左右。

## 日程安排、门票和地点
此次会议将于9月21日（周五）下午开始，到时将组织巡游运河、参观阿姆斯特丹证券交易所（[AEX](https://www.aex.nl/amsterdam-exchange-experience)）等多种形式的联谊活动。事实上，阿姆斯特丹证券交易所是世界上第一个股票交易所——这一点很像世间首次诞生的BitShares区块链，只不过前者出现于400年前。此次会议的主要日程将安排在9月22日（周六），届时将举办演讲、创业推介会和各种交流活动。当晚，与会者可自愿选择参加在阿姆斯特丹市中心举办的步行晚宴。9月23日（周日），将借周末之机为BitShares、石墨烯和区块链爱好者们安排一次午餐见面会。

目前，我们已拟定了网站的草案内容。通过该网站可订购门票、显示会议的日程安排和演讲嘉宾，以及查看有关于比特集会的一般信息。当然，网站内容可能变更。如感兴趣，可查看此处： https://bitfestamsterdam.eventbrite.co.uk

We already found a suitable venue for BitFest. The building is located in the city centre of Amsterdam and has an industrial atmosphere. The venue offers several separate rooms which allows us to run a rich program of speakers and activities. Each room can have its own theme and visitors can go where they like. All activities are on walking distance from each other and in a compact (lovely canal) area around the central station.

## Community Involvement BitFest Program, Topics, and Speakers
We have already set up a basic plan, found a great venue and prepared a website. For determining the final program content, topics to be discussed and which speakers to invite, we would like to involve the Community. This means that we would like to offer the opportunity to the community to apply for presentations first.

## Our Proposal
This is the first conference especially targeted specifically for the BitShares Community. We believe that it will be an amazing and inspiring weekend for all involved and we are really passionate to organize it. However, as it is the first conference in its kind, it is hard to estimate how many participants there will be and whether it will be a success or not. Therefore, we would like to ask the Community to cover our risk. For instance, when too few tickets are sold we would have to incur a loss for the fixed costs as venue reservation, invited speakers, website costs besides the effort we put into planning and organizing BitFest. This means that, we, as a non-profit organization run a risk here, and we do not want a body with losses.

With this Worker, we ask the Community to cover the costs and penalties of 20.000 EUR that would arise if we would have to cancel the conference up to a month before the planned date. This concerns costs related to the venue rent, penalties on planned activities, penalties on hired event personal, invited speakers, and catering. We have not done any final reservations/obligations yet. As soon as this worker proposal is approved, we will put our plan into action and make all necessary reservations and start contractual obligations.

What happens with the money if BitFest will be a success? Well, we have got a plan for that, too. In that case, we will use the funds provided by the Community to keep the ticket prices low, so attending the conference will be feasible for more people. Furthermore, a part of the funds will be spend on merchandise and marketing of BitFest.

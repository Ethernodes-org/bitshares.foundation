# **Introduction**

This year’s 'Decentralized' conference will be held at my hometown of Athens, Greece between the 30th of October and 1st of November 2019. As some of you may remember, I set up a similar worker last year for a plain sponsorship of the conference by BitShares which went really well. Conference last year was attended by me, Ryan R. Fox, Michael Taggart and spokesperson Annemieke Dirkes and we had 2 session talks and a booth that gathered a lot of interest from attendees. 

This year we got a very nice offer from the organizers to present the conference as partners (i.e. Decentralized 2019 by University of Nicosia and BitShares). This offer includes:

- Becoming event partners
- Decentralized Conference listed and marketed everywhere as POWERED BY UNIC AND BitShares. This includes all their own paid marketing campaigns. Next push starts on July 10th
- BitShares logo on name badges and lanyards
- BitShares video as screensaver on all stages between sessions
- Paid production of a sponsor-dedicated event-video after the event
- Private BitShares named meeting room at the conference
- Video presentation/ad to be played during coffee break
- Partner mention/thank you during opening/closing of conference
- Double booth in best location in Exhibition Hall
- 1 x Plenary/Keynote speaker
- 4 x Session speakers
- 1 x BitShares organized panel-session (3 panelists + 1 moderator)
- 25 x free conference registrations (normal price for the full conference is in the ~$500 range)
- 50% off for additional registrations/BitShares members
- 50% off for additional booths for BitShares partners (5k instead of 10k)
- 3-night accomodation at the conference hotel for 2 people
- Full page ad in the conference brochure
- Inclusion of BitShares branded item/gift in the conference gift bag
- 1-year's membership in the IFF (more details here: https://www.unic.ac.cy/iff/ + https://github.com/clockworkgr/worker-proposals/blob/master/20190313%20-%20IFF%20Presentation.pdf )
- Ability to pay University of Nicosia courses tuition fees in BTS/bitUSD/bitEUR

Information about last year’s event can be found here: https://www.decentralized.com/speakers-2018/ and about our previous worker here: https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=27272.0


# **Worker Intent**

The goals of this worker are as follows:

- Increase awareness of the BitShares platform and its capabilities as well as real-world uses by businesses
- Take advantage of networking opportunities by taking part as a group.
- Increase exposure of the BitShares brand via sponsorship exposure.
- Take advantage of Decentralized’s own media campaign
- Increase exposure of BitShares-based businesses
- Create shareable & promotable content


# **Suggested Representation**

The team to attend the conference via the 25 passes included in the sponsorship package should be varied in terms of focus. The worker will pay for travel and accommodation of all representatives.

First of all, 4 BitShares-based businesses will each receive passes and expenses for 2 people in order to attend and present one speaker session each.

The businesses (TBC) are:
- Openledger
- BitSpark
- Everprove
- One CN-based company TBD

This leaves an additional 17 invitations to be distributed which I am currently in discussions in order to finalize. The following is just suggestions: 

- Myself: Alex Megalokonomos (clockwork): Committee member/Witness/Beet project/UI Team
- Ryan R. Fox (BitShares Core)
- Additional Core Team members
- BBF representatives
- UI Team members
- Additional committee members
- Various Active Worker representatives (DEXBot, BitShares.org)
- Regional representatives (e.g. Petr/Xanoxt for the Russian community etc.)

## **Budget**

Due to an ideal deadline for completing a 20% down-payment on the partnership package prior to July 10th in order to take advantage of the University of Nicosia’s next media push starting then I am bringing this worker on-chain for voting on an ASAP basis with some details (such as the exact members of the team taking part) still TBD.

For the same reason, the worker has a daily pay to ensure required funds are acquired in time.

Cost breakdown is as follows:


 | Item                                     | Pay (USD)   |
 | ---------------------------------------- | :---------: |
 | Partnership package & IFF membership     | Up to ~$135,000.00 |
 | Travel expenses (flights accommodation etc.) Up to $2,000 pp  * 24 people  | Up to $8,000.00 |
 | 2,000 x BitShares-branded gifts (e.g. USB stick)  | Up to $8,000.00 |
 | Promotional Material production  | Up to $7,000.00 |
 | Other unexpected expenses (full Invoices will be presented if incurred) | Up to $1,500.00 |

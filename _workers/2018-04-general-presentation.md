## General
As reported in the Spokesperson reports of January 11th 2018 and March
2nd, the BitShares community faces serious issues as a result of the
information that is presented to the public, international regulators,
lawmakers and investors with respect to BitShares as a platform, its
native core token BTS as well as the value proposition of the entire
ecosystem. The main source of this information has always been
bitshares.org. Thus, the legal counsel of BitShares Blockchain
Foundation, Paul Hastings, advised us to remove this content immediately
and start from scratch with regulatory terminology in mind under a
non-profit entity.

Until recently, the domain bitshares.org was owned by Cryptonomex Inc.
and could not be obtained by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation, as
described in the latest Spokesperson report. So far, the content on that
domain has been provided by BitShares community members. This, however,
has resulted in marginal modifications over the last years, despite
growing regulatory pressure. Since then, the domain bitshares.org has
been transferred to @apasia.tech, a Bangkok-based Blockchain company.

We'd like to express to the new owner of bitshares.org that we are
open-minded for future collaboration to find a solution that best suits
the ecosystem. In the meantime, we would like to propose the following
solution, since regulatory pressure is immediate.

## The plan
With our ongoing efforts to rework presentation of the BitShares
Blockchain and its native core token BTS to the general public,
including new whitepapers, regulatory clarity as well as new
documentation portals, we would like to present a clearer picture of
what we will need for the future. So far, we have secured the following
internet domains and are going to launch them:

* **bitshares.legal** (*BBF managed*) - Aggregation of all relevant
  information for lawyers and regulators to get a clear and accurate
  picture of what the BitShares Blockchain is and what the BTS token
  represents with all the details properly described in appropriate
  terminology. Content here clearly targets lawyers and regulators with
  appropriate documentation that rarely changes. bitshares.works
  (*Community managed*) - This domain is meant to become the main hub of
  end-user information and thus will contain user guides, instructions,
  tutorials as well as some basic technical documentation. The content on
  this page will be community driven (e.g. through the approved
  documentation worker) similar to the previous documentation portal
  hosted on docs.bitshares.eu. The documentation part of bitshares.eu will
  ultimately only contain a redirect to the new site with compliments to
  BitShares Europe. However, the BitShares Blockchain Foundation needs to
  clarify the scope of this portal and the terminology used properly so as
  not to interfere with the content of sites like bitshares.legal.

* **bitshares.foundation** (*BBF managed*) - Presentation of the
  BitShares Blockchain and its native core token BTS as a platform for
  the general audience. The new whitepaper as well as general information
  will be made available here. Targeting the general public, the content
  here will only improve as necessary (e.g. when new features are
  implemented on the BitShares Blockchain). This portal will also serve as
  a communication center with respect to the services offered by the
  BitShares Blockchain Foundation (the legal entity) such as the worker
  program, the mailing lists or actions undertaken as spokesperson. Non
  commercial activity only. The first document is likely to go online at
  the end of this week as it is needed in the case of Bittrex Inc.

* **bitshares.exchange** (*Community managed*) - This domain will be
  the entry point to the BitShares Blockchain and will host the
  reference wallet previously at wallet.bitshares.org. Even though the
  domain is owned by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation, we would like to
  grant access to its content to the BitShares UI team and leave the
  potential use of subdomains up to them. You can see possible suggestions
  in the appendix. As a consequence of this, new terms and conditions for
  this deployment will need to be written. Furthermore, it needs to be
  made clear that similar to the previous reference wallet installation,
  it is the job of the wider BitShares community to provide technical
  support for users of this platform until a solution is found for a
  general technical support team since technical support lies outside the
  scope of this worker.

* **bitsharestalk.org** (*Community managed*) - This domain was recently
  obtained from Bitsapphire and will continue to host forums for open
  communications between the wider BitShares community members. As such,
  the content is community driven and will be moderated by community
  members as usual. Best practice and etiquette applies.

We propose a uniform BitShares look-and-feel on all the new sites (based
around the current logo) while working towards a better and more
complete corporate identity. Further details and reasoning can be found
in the appendix.

## Costs
This worker proposal comes at a cost. The costs are separated into costs
for securing the internet domains and the development costs for the new
and updated web sites. Costs below are the maximum that could possible
be needed and as always we will try for a more economical approach,
leveraging work already done by the community where possible. Any
unspent funds will be refunded to the reserve pool as usual.

```
Domain Costs:                $15k
Corporate Identity:    up to $20k
Web Development:       up to $10k
Content:               Delivered through existing workers (documentation, legal-counsel, compliance)
```

We would like to emphasise that the BitShares Blockchain Foundation
would like to make use of the bitUSD worker program it runs and deliver
full transparency and accountability through public statements, invoices
and accounting, as usual.

## Time frame
The domains have been acquired already. BitSharesTalk.org has been
migrated already. As soon as the team behind bitshares-ui development is
ready, bitshares.exchange will go operational. The documentation for
bitshares.works is an ongoing effort that will fill in the content as it
becomes available and is approved. BitShares.legal will be filled in as
soon as the lawyers are able to release information to the public. Once
this worker has been approved, web development as well as the
development of the corporate identity will be initiated.

## Appendix: Why did we propose to use multiple domains
The BBF wants to be clear about separation of concerns as well as
responsibilities. While the BitShares Blockchain Foundation wants to
provide peer-reviewed, accurate and legally revised content, we want to
also provide a platform for the community to provide value to the entire
ecosystem. For that reason, the BitShares Blockchain Foundation provides
the content for `bitshares.foundation` as well as `bitshares.legal`. The
goal is to present the BitShares Blockchain and the native core token to
its full extend and with utmost precision with legal terminology in
mind. This content is supposed to rarely change once finalized. On the
other hand, we want to provide community-driven platforms and
documentation via the other domains.The separation of concerns is
important to allow experts of different fields to quickly understand
where to find relevant information and gauge its quality.

#### BitShares.Works
While the actual implementation is up to the community, we would like to
propose the following use of the domain bitshares.works:

* `how.bitshares.works`: Main documentation portal
* `committee.bitshares.works`: Committee news & announcements (alpha already live)
* `dev.bitshares.works`: Developer portal
* `spec.dev.bitshares.works`: Technical specifications
* `backend.dev.bitshares.works`: Doxygen material of the backend
* `ui.dev.bitshares.works`: Technical specs of the UI
* `py.dev.bitshares.works`: pybitshares documentation
* `js.dev.bitshares.works`: JS documentation (bitsharesjs, -ws)

#### BitShares.Exchange
We propose to place a short landing page to give a very brief
introduction of the BitShares Blockchain and provide links to the reader
for further investigation of the technological, and regulatory aspects
of the platform. We recommend to deploy anything that is operationally
beneficial for the wallet and user interface:

* `my.bitshares.exchange`: Main wallet as developed by the bitshares-ui team
* `explore.bitshares.exchange`: Block explorer

#### BitShares.Foundation
This domain serves as a presentation of the BitShares Blockchain
Foundation as a legal entity and approved spokesperson of the BitShares
Blockchain. Given our desire to separate concerns, we propose to host
the following aspects on this domain:

 * Whitepapers
 * Corporate Identity
 * Links to other resources
 * Spokesperson reports
 * Escrow workers

#### BitSharesTalk.org
As before, we would like to keep this forum a place for open and
constructive discussions and disputes. This place is entirely community
driven and the BitShares Blockchain Foundation prefers to not interfere
with what is going on there.

## Conclusion
This worker proposal has two general aspects that need BTS holder
approvals. Firstly, the BTS holders need to agree on the new setup
provided by multiple domains that are not bitshares.org to represent the
BitShares Blockchain in the public. Secondly, funding to reach this goal
needs to be obtained from the working budget (reserves) of the BitShares
Blockchain.

# Budget proposal

This is a budget proposal that specifically aims to establish a
financial base for the Bitshares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) for a
specific purpose (here: Translations into Chinese). We consider this
necessary in order to be flexible and properly represent the BitShares
ecosystem with a peer review process to keep quality standards. This
budget is restricted in its spending and can only be used for tasks
listed in the **Budget spending restrictions** section. Furthermore,
proposals of this kind do not necessarily spend the entire budget but
merely pay individual invoices. These invoices will be public to hold
the BitShares Blockchain Foundation fully accountable. **Unused budget
will be returned.**

# Motivation

The BBF aims to increase market penetration and recognition of the
BitShares platform. Currently, most of the advertising material and news
articles are in English. To support the Chinese market, we seek to
establish a translation budget that enables translations of relevant
publications into Chinese. The BBFâ€™s task is to select appropriate
publications, either by hand-picking them or through suggestions by the
community (e.g. by tagging the BBF in the comments).

# Budget spending restrictions

This budget can only be used for:
* Fees for managing the budget (e.g. invoicing, tax processing)
* Preparing publication channels for a seamless integration of
  multi-lingual articles (front and backend adjustments), if possible
* Headhunting and monitoring suitable translation freelancer(s)
  (including reviewing translation quality)
* Translating publication material (advertising, news, etc.) to Chinese

This proposal is limited to a period of 6 months at a maximum of 1000
USD per month. That means that a maximum of 6000 USD can be spend if
this worker is accepted. Invoices will be publicly auditable. All unused
funds will be transferred back at the end of the 6 month period. 

Administration and controlling will be done by a 3rd party. 

# Requirements for translators

This proposal seeks for a budget to spend for high quality translations.
It is open for professional translators to apply for translation tasks
and either get paid on a word-count or hourly basis (to be agreed on
individually). In order to apply as a translator these requirements need
to be fulfilled:
* Business proficient in (Simplified) Chinese
* Known real-world identity (for invoicing and accountability)
* BitShares account required (for on-chain payment in bitUSD)

# First steps

The first goal is to prepare the Website of the BitShares Blockchain
Foundation  in order to obtain a seamless and user-friendly integration
of multi-language articles. One of the first articles that we seek to
get translated is Crypto-Currencies as Medium of Payment, because it
explains a key aspect of the BitShares ecosystem (the BitAsset).

# To the BTS holders

The BBF as the elected spokesperson of the BitShares platform will
publish news on important events concerning BitShares as well as doing
promotion of existing articles to increase the level of awareness to the
public regarding BitShares. Since the Chinese market is one of the most
important ones in the  BitShares ecosystem, it is important that said
user base can be reached and informed properly. 

The partner Blockchain Projects BV has offered to take care of the
administration and controlling of this translation budget.

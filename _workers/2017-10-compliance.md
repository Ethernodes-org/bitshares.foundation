# Introduction

As many already know, there was an announcement made by a major exchange
partner to de-list BTS from their books. This resulted in a loss of $100
Mio. in BitShares valuation. In combination with market pegged assets,
this resulted in unpleasant and unforeseeable consequences for many
BitShares users.

The de-listing indicates a trend in recent activity by the SEC and other
regulators and governments worldwide that will only increase as the
whole blockchain space matures. This trend is a strong signal for
BitShares to adapt to new conditions that rapidly close in on the
platform. The strength of BitShares is that of technical superiority,
but by nature of its decentralized and autonomous community organization
all the rest is not continuously attended, unlike most other platforms
which generally have strong, centralized developer teams. This has left
BitShares with poor marketing, outdated  and often incorrect
documentation and a lack of general coordination, whether it be in
development or in communicating with exchanges and regulatory bodies. In
order to address these issues we are making this proposal.

# Proposal

## Market Exposure

The objective is to stabilize and further the position of BitShares as a
whole in the market by leading the process towards better market
exposure of BitShares and improved market liquidity by means of having
BTS (and other assets) listed on more exchanges.

## Regulatory Compliance

Given our recent experiences, we see significant need for an overhaul of
the BitShares brand in order to ensure SEC compliance and further
listings on more exchanges. These require intensive research as well as
major rework of existing material including, but not limited to,
documentation, web presences, front- and backend code as well as the
public perception of BitShares. It is our desire to lead these efforts.

# Budget

Letting things go and hoping for the best no longer works and is too
dangerous. Similar to existing proposals supported by the BitShares
Blockchain Foundation, we will be using a restricted budget with a
timesheet to track time spend that will be monthly reported and
invoiced. Monthly invoices will be provided publicly.

That said, this proposal is asking for ongoing funding though the
BitShares Blockchain Reserves and seeks a **budget of 50,000 bitUSD for
the next 15 months**, payable from October 10th 2017 until December 31st
2018.

## Milestone-based Bounties

Additionally to the fixed budget, we would like to grow our importance
and influence within the BitShares ecosystem by becoming a BTS token
holder of the DAC based on the performance we deliver. We propose to go
for a milestone based agreement that **pays in BTS** (escrowed
through the BitShares Blockchain Foundation):

* $25,000 worth of BTS if we manage to convince Bittrex Inc. to keep listing BTS
* $25,000 worth of BTS if we convince Bittrex Inc. to list a bitUSD pair
  or other on-/off ramp
* $50,000 worth of BTS in each case we convince an exchange
  (i.e. Kraken, bitstamp, coinbase, bitcoin.de) to list any asset (pair)
  that is primarily hosted on BitShares.

# What to expect from us

* We are going to respond to the regulatory bodies in order to defend
  the BitShares platform (*this requires an approved spokesman*)
* Identify issues that prevent us from growing
* Propose changes to the BTS holders in order to become compliant with
  specific regulations
* advice the BitShares holders about the progress in the blockchain
  space w.r.t. compliance and regulations

BitShares Core Team Continuing Resolution Budget - 2019
=======================================================

* Author: Ryan R. Fox (`"fox"`)
* [国语翻译](mandarin_translation.md) Mandarin Translation: TBD(`"TBD"`)

Intent
======

* Establish a _short-term_ **budget** to sustain the development efforts of the BitShares Core Team until a _full-year_ budget is negotiated
* Continue **funding efforts** based on Core Team Budget (2018) rates [1]
* Use **bitCNY for remittances** rather than bitUSD due to current market state

Background
==========

The BitShares Core Team was established in 2018 to deliver protocol
enhancements and maintain the project for the decentralized autonomous
community (DAC). The funding mechanism and scope for the 2019 Core Team
Budget remain in active review and require additional time to finalize,
communicate to the Community and allow time for proper voting. This
_continuing resolution_ allows the Core Team to continue its primary
development efforts and negotiate a new worker proposal for 2019.

Worker
======

This is a Budget Worker Proposal which provides funding through January 2019 for:
* BitShares Core Team Roles
* Collaboration Tools
* Development Initiatives

Please refer to the Core Team 2018 Budget [1] for details thereof.

The following table represents the CNY equivalent rates to replace the corresponding Table 2. in the 
2018 Worker Proposal. _Note: 1 USD = 6.88 CNY_

**Table 2. Core Team Roles and Rates**

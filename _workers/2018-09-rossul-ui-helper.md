# Intent

This is a helper worker to obtain the needed budget for the completion
of the original worker <a href="2018-09-rossul-ui">ROSSUL - Bitshares Exchange UX/UI Redesign Project</a>


The project team has confirmed that the originally laid out budget is still up to date and the work can be finished with it. This worker proposal has a depreciation factor of 1.75, which results in a asked for daily BTS payout of 42,404. The duration is intentionally chosen longer to allow for a one month buffer.

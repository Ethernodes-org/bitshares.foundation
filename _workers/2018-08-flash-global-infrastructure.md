# **Introduction**

In October 2017, BitShares eco-system encountered serious problems with
its existing infrastructure at that point. APAsia.tech recognized the
problem, and coming from Corporate Development and Hosting business,
decided to help the eco-system and enable access to it’s users in most
important period of crypto (fall in November, rise in December) to
BitShares users by starting a node.  First node in Thailand occurred on
1st of November and was introduced on bitsharestalk.org. Followed by
support and partnership with Move Institute, Slovenia joined, project
expanded and we were running 6 nodes by end of December covering most
critical points such as USA and Asia, with just one node in EU. With
growth in demand from entire BitShares eco-system, APAsia.tech expanded
this to collaboration with DAOStreet, Move Institute (as mentioned) and
Open Asset, ending up today with 26 online servers, 2 status pages for
the infrastructure and Premium SSL protection for all with on-going
maintenance. 

# **Worker Intent**

We intend to provide more resources to existing infrastructure, to
continue collaboration and maintenance of infrastructure we delivered
over the past 8 months. We kept going our financial contribution to the
blockchain for a while, have learned and experienced a lot, and finally
come to a point where we can’t face another invoice or/and upgrades
needed to continue with fully operational infrastructure.  We would like
to keep the built of existing infrastructure for the period of next 6
months, upgrade smaller nodes from APT@Vultr, activate missing DDOS
protection and polish security on the upgraded/new nodes.
 
Launch of Infrastructure requires:

*	Approval of this proposal
*	5 Business days to complete Vultr APT upgrades/replay blockchains where needed.
*	3 Business days to provide full report with status page for this worker.
*	Acknowledgment from Stake-Holders that this worker and its Public API nodes are for non-commercial USE only (we have limits on nodes).

# **Worker Proposal**

## **Distributed Network of BitShares API Nodes**

The twentyfive deployed BitShares Public API nodes

    1.	bitshares.nu
    2.	singapore.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    3.	japan.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    4.	new-york.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    5.	us-la.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    6.	seattle.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    7.	chicago.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    8.	dallas.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    9.	valley.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    10.	miami.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    11.	atlanta.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    12.	slovenia.bitshares.apasia.tech
    13.	australia.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    14.	england.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    15.	france.bitshares.apasia.tech (to be upgraded)
    16.	scali10.daostreet.com
    17.	seoul9.daostreet.com
    18.	frankfurt8.daostreet.com
    19.	paris7.daostreet.com
    20.	canada6.daostreet.com
    21.	ncali5.daostreet.com
    22.	ohio4.daostreet.com
    23.	virginia3.daostreet.com
    24.	oregon2.daostreet.com
    25.	status200.bitshares.apasia.tech

## **Distributed Network for BitShares TestNet**

The deployed BitShares testnet node

    1. testnet.bitshares.apasia.tech

## **Public Status Pages**

We have currently one page in production stage:
http://status.apasia.tech (production)

And one staging page that we have long term to place as global status
page on bitshares.org (status.bitshares.org) and that would be listing
all Public API of BitShares that are reported as active/approved by
current BitShares Github.

## **Milestones**

* Upgrade 14 nodes (within 5 business days from the activation of the Worker) and maintain deployed infrastructure for the BitShares DAC and this Worker.
* Maintain uptime tracking/monitoring through status.apasia.tech on all nodes from this Worker with a start date from the date when/if the Worker gets approved.
*	Provide 80% of up-time as average on 6 months. 
* Continue maintenance of quiry system for issue reporting.
*	Move Staging 2 Production of Global Public API monitoring for entire BitShares eco-system through status.bitshares.org
*	Create public documentation on source builds for various OS deployments and server specifications/requirements. 
*	Establish better communication with @xeroc, @abit, @clockwork, @fox on weekly basis - to provide better support page, improve current documentation and expand support to more OS choices to node owners. 

*More nodes will be added/removed in the most economical manner preserving best functionality and global API availability.*

## **Costs Summary**

 | Item                               | Price       | Fee/Expense           | 
 | ---------------------------------- | :---------: | --------------------: | 
 | 26 nodes monthly - various ISPs    | $3,380.00   | Expense per month     | 
 | Infrastructure Management          | $0.00       | Fee                   | 
 | Status Page development            | $0.00       | Fee                   | 
 | DDOS Upgrade/as add2Monthly        | $120.00     | Expense per month     | 
 | TOTAL (per Month):                 | $3,500.00   |                       |

*Based on carefully done estimate and months of experience with
presented infrastructure, APAsia.tech and collaborators are asking
BitShares blockchain for the Budget of $25,500.00, where $22,000.00
would be going on 6 months COST of renting the nodes/upgrades for the
infrastructure, and $3,500.00 would be going as 1 time small
reimbursement FEE for the initial setup and endurance/good will of good
people team has.*

# Introduction

Dear BitShares community,

**This worker proposal requests a relatively small sponsorship for the annual SteemFest, this year in it's 4th edition, heading to Asia! To be held in various locations across Bangkok, Thailand from 6 to 10 november 2019. The goal of this worker is to promote the Bitshares chain and ecosystem during this Graphene oriented community event.**

## SteemFest⁴: 6/7/8/9/10 November, Bangkok, Thailand
[SteemFest](https://steemfest.com) is the annual get together focussed
on bringing steem users together in real life to learn from eachother
and have a good time. Both conference days are filled with
presentations, workshops and panels for steem users, by steem users. At
nights some social events are happening and in the weekend attendees
have ample time to explore the city, tourist wise :P - Steem has
become the defacto standard blogging tool for (graphene based)
blockchain announcements and for example witness announcements of all
sorts. Many Steem users know of BitShares and use it, but there is still
work to be done. Did you know that just like last year, this year you can also buy your
SteemFest ticket with BTS?

SteemFest's conference program is still in the works. Previous 3 years over 1000 people attended  the event from 60+ countries.

SteemFest is heading to Asia for the first time since it's inception:
- **2016: Amsterdam, The Netherlands**: [site](https://steemfest.com/2016), [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11rr8RO2oj8&list=PLuFTH4WVRM7wL3LvkpydI-KJ0K52cHolP)
- **2017: Lisbon, Portugal**: [site](https://steemfest.com/2017), [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukng066KRH8&list=PLuFTH4WVRM7zSHdEUtu2Lo_QXzzOgptj7), [after video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz7rWNoBvJs)
- **2018: Kraków, Poland**: [site](https://steemfest.com/2018), [livestreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei7FPtYoWac&list=PLuFTH4WVRM7z7HhyDjG0P6EXNkRjuB6Gx), [after video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pBifgRwZyQ)

See https://steemfest.com for more info.

## Organisation's Experience
SteemFest is organised by @roelandp with help from a group of enthusiast supporters during the event days. My experience in events is imho considerable: being co-organiser of TodaysArt.org for 5 years (3 years fulltime, 2 years parttime) and 2 Music Hackathon Amsterdam events and 3 Liberty Global 'Appathons' (and ofcourse organising SteemFest 1,2,3) gives me quite the experience in organising these events.

## BitShares sponsorship
A sponsorship by Bitshares on SteemFest will give a lot of shine to Bitshares, as the core principle for Steemfest is to be as accessible as possible by having a low entry level ticket price for plankton/minnow users and then gradually building up prices for those who can afford more. Thanks to the sponsorships, tickets for plankton & minnow users are priced well under the actual cost price.

_Bitshares will literally be profiled as a very kind philanthropist making the event possible to attend for those not so wealthy. It is a great way to demonstrate the power of this blockchain._

This sponsorship through a worker would give BitShares:
1. Growth in brand recognition:
   - deep integration in all event's promotional media (see below)
   - tbd: dedicated rollup banner 'booth' at the "wall of dapps" expo during conference days in the breaks-area.
2. A chance to attract new users to BitShares by:
   - getting a **20 minute presentation slot at main SteemFest⁴ event**  one of the conference days.
   - using 3 unique competition rounds for the 5 included SteemFest tickets to the event to raise awareness for Bitshares (see below)

# BitShares SteemFest⁴ Sponsorship - What's included

1. **5 x full (5 day) conference give-away tickets** giving access to all events of SteemFest (10 venues), which will be raffled under the name of the Bitshares chain in a dedicated post(s) on Steem which in themselves form  _"engagement advertising events"_ for Bitshares, as I envision the following 3 competitions for the 5 free tickets through a dedicated account on Steem (@bitshares-at-sf)[https://steemit.com/@bitshares-at-sf]:
   - BTS-Steemfest⁴ Competition 1: (2 x 1 ticket) - simple raffle: Steem users can participate by leaving a comment with their BTS account including a resteem. If they don't have one, they should get one.
   - BTS Steemfest⁴ Competition 2: (1 x 1 ticket) - Promotion: Make an artwork/video/blog/podcast/work featuring Bitshares and/or it's core feature: decentralised exchange. Post your work on your Steem account, leave a comment which also includes your BTS account. (If you don't have one, you should get one).
   - BTS Steemfest⁴ Competition 3: (2 x 1 ticket) - Student ticket: 2 tickets will be given to students who apply for the Bitshares-SteemFest free student tickets. Applications should be posted on Steem chain with the reason why s/he should be given a student-ticket. Obviously only  students can apply.

2. **2 x full (5 day) conference tickets for official BitShares delegates**. To be used for 1-2 speakers attending SteemFest on behalf of the BitShares Blockchain.

3. **BitShares Speaking Slot**: option to do a Bitshares related presentation on stage provided a speaker volunteer wants to do this.

4. **BitShares branding (logo)** included on:
   - website
   - mobile app
   - printed map of Bangkok
   - every attendees badge
   - opening slides
   - all future official event announcements on Steem
   - every future newsletter (to about 1000 steem users / previous attendees)
   - on the digital pdf tickets every attendee obtains
   - and wherever deemed reasonable in the event decorations (like banners, video bannering decorations, etcetera)
   - a dedicated rollup banner booth for Bitshares to be placed in the "Wall of dApps" expo along 15-20 products/services

5. **BitShares branded insert in the goodiebag for all attendees** - brochure, sticker or both.

6. **BEET voting widget** on steemfest.com to show the power of the Bitshares DAO worker system.

# Funding needed

This sponsorship costs 10,000 EURO (bitCNY 80,000). Left-over BTS will be refunded.

# Usage of sponsorship money

The sponsorship money will be used to cover the generic event budget and therefor helps lower the ticket price for those not so wealthy. Like previous years, we aim to have the lowest ticketprice for SteemFest at 50% of the actual cost price per attendee. This is only possible thanks to sponsorships. A Bitshares sponsorship enables about 35-50 additional of these lowest priced tickets.

# Milestones

The following milestones have been defined for tracking progress of this worker:
- Event announced / venues arranged, see https://steemfest.com
- Including BEET Vote widget on https://steemfest.com
- Bitshares logo integration in online media (newsletters, website, event announcement, digital tickets)
- Bitshares give-away ticket competition announcement
- Bitshares logo integration on onsite decorations and printed matters
- Bitshares rollup banner booth on site
- SteemFest event itself: 6-10 November

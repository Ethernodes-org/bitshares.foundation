## Motivation

In recent history, the BitShares Community has been talking a lot about
furthering the use of the BitShares Blockchain and its core native token BTS
with the clear goal of a broader adoption, increased volume, liquidity, and
outreach. On this subject, marketing and ease-of-use are just as important, and
we, [Blockchain Projects B.V.](https://www.blockchainprojectsbv.com/), want to
tackle the next consequent step for that.

In our view, one of the vital points is an increase of use-cases for BTS
amongst a larger group of people and the use of BTS in transferring it to
others in any given circumstance.

Ideally, we manage to get BTS listed on a credit/debit card with tight fiat
(offramp) integration. By this, we would leave the restriction to
crypto-currency exchanges and become accessible to Millions of ATMs and
Merchants.

Once we have such a  card that accepts BTS the next step is to aim for BitAsset
integration. From a technical viewpoint the effort is marginal, most work will
be in the background to comply to the regulatory requirements.

## Worker Intent

Months of preparations, intensive phone calls and business development lead to
a verbal agreement from credit card processor [Wirex](https://wirexapp.com) to
list BTS. We believe that Wirex comes with a reasonable cost-benefit ratio and
has an excellent reputation in the space. Wirex comes with 2.2 million
registered users and the WirexApp provides access to Euro, British Pound and US
Dollar and supports Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, WAVES, NANO, DAI and
XLM.

Notably, its debit card services run over VISA.

Wirex is a well established and fully regulated company, properly outfitted
with KYC and compliance. All information on its services, terms and conditions
can be found on [wirexapp.com](http://www.wirexapp.com/). Its service also
entails an affiliate program and a reward for use. We invite everyone to read
up on the details.

We see this as a highly desirable functionality. As BTS is listed on known
technical structures we have been offered this opportunity at much less than
the usual price.

Depending on their worker load and schedule, Wirex technical team can integrate
BitShares within 4 weeks.

### Legalities

We might need to secure additional legal opinion letters at their request, but
fortunately the BitShares Blockchain Foundation has a complete legal opinion
paper that was done by PaulHastings that applies for U.S. jurisdictions. The
budget accounts for efforts of transferring that to the European jurisdiction
as Wirex resides in London and is licensed by UK FCA (this budget is optional
		and only spent if required)..

### Marketing Aspect

Marketing BTS to Wirexapp has been worked on for many months already and has
resulted in an actual offer from Wirexapp. Apart from being a major
advertisement for the BitShares Blockchain, namely one of the oldest and most
stable blockchains around, the community would  massively increase its outreach
and get access to over 2 million people that might be not aware of BitShares
and BTS. This  would generate publicity world wide and result in free press
coverage that would otherwise need a hefty marketing budget to stem by itself
with the same outreach. Not to mention the potential increase in transactions
and utility of our blockchain.

## Budget Requirements

We need to establish and save funds as part is paid on signing the agreement
(setup fee). We have come to an understanding that Wirex would integrate BTS if
funding is secured. What is left is to now ask you, the BitShares community, to
approve the required budget to take this further.

This worker comes with three milestones:

* The worker becomes **active**: This gives a clear signal towards Wirex that integration is desired. We start with preparations of legal requirements as needed.
* The worker is fully **funded**: The integration part at Wirex kicks in after paying the setup fee.
* **Operations**: Ongoing monthly expenses for Wirex are covered for as long as the funds suffice, but limited to 12 months.

In case the worker is not fully funded, but covers expenses, project management
and fees, the time BTS is available on Wirex may be shorter than 12 months.  In
case legal requirements cannot be met, any left-over funds will be returned.

The world wide operations of the Wirex services will cost a monthly fee of
**5,000 $**. That is a continuing obligation and compared to other services
very reasonable. A one-time fee from Wirex applies that includes technical
integration work (includes the previously mentioned setup fee). An optional
budget is added  to cover any necessary legal expenses if required. Lastly,
there is a management and escrow overhead.

Final acceptance is up to Wirex due to regulatory input from their lawyers. In
case of refusal, the funds will be returned (minus expenses).

## Project Partner

[Blockchain Projects B.V.](https://www.blockchainprojectsbv.com/), a Dutch
company, will take the lead in project managing the integration and take care
of legal requirements. We would like to emphasize, that no side-agreements or
kickbacks for Blockchain Projects exist that would benefit us.  The BitShares
Blockchain Foundation has agreed to become the escrow for this worker proposal
and take care of contracting on the legal side.

## Summary

The BitShares community has long requested integration into a credit card
network. With many businesses in the space appearing and disappearing again due
to more strict regulatory requirements, we believe that now is a good time to
introduce BTS to Wirex.

Additionally, if required by Wirex, we will pursue a legal opinion letter for
BTS that applies specifically to European regulations for the BitShares
community, which will be made available to the BitShares Blockchain Foundation
as well.

We see an integration of BTS as an enormous opportunity for the BitShares
Blockchain Community. With one stroke, many imminent topics would be hit that
were addressed in marketing, liquidity and utility. Therefore we urge the BTS
voters to consider supporting this worker proposal.

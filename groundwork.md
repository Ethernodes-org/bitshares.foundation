## Groundwork

Major groundwork has been performed for the BitShares Blockchain
and its core native token BTS to succeed over current and future
regulatory and technological challenges by many sources over the
last years. In a decentralized autonomous community, every person
or company can initiate actions by his or her own accord to
participate. By choice such an initiative can be put to vote on
the blockchain. Votes and accounts are anonymous.

The very basic structure of the Bitshares Blockchain implicitly
constitutes that individuals as well as companies are left to their own
judgement regarding their public appearance and information provided.
As a permissionless blockchain, there is no control mechanism on account
and asset creation, projects or otherwise. The Bitshares Blockchain Foundation
therefore clearly points out that it has no influence, control or benefit
over any activity on the Bitshares Blockchain or its core native
token BTS.

## Groundwork

Major groundwork needs to be performed for BitShares to succeed over
current and future regulatory and technological challenges. The
BitShares Blockchain Foundation seeks to take the lead on those.

Throughout the last couple months, we have been repeatedly approach
about core aspects of BitShares and its governance token BTS that have
been presented publicly in an inaccurate and unfavorable manner. This
often resulted in ambiguity and uncertainty that has held back some
businesses from working with or on the BitShares Blockchain and could
well have been a reason for lack of ecosystem growth throughout the last
years.

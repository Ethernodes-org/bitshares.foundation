## Transparency

We want to serve an open and trust-less ecosystem. As such, we provide
full transparency to the BitShares network.

### Communication

Decentralized networks come with a high need of cooperation and coordination.
To facilitate this need on a technical level, we provide open and transparent
mailing lists for developers, block producers, committee members, token holders,
and projects running on top of BitShares.
{[mailing lists](http://lists.bitshares.foundation)}

### Accounting

Since we are in the fortunate position to have received sufficient trust from
BTS token holders to successfully operate [multiple escrow
workers](http://www.bitshares.foundation/worker), we feel the need to be as
transparent as humanly possible to these token holders as to how the funds are
used. {[more](/accounting)}

# Tasks

## Transparent Communication

Decentralized networks come with a high need of cooperation and coordination.
To facilitate this need on a technical level, we provide open and transparent
mailing lists for developers, block producers, committee members and
shareholders.

[Go to the mailing lists](http://lists.bitshares.foundation)

## Escrow Workers

The BitShares Foundation takes a lead in managing worker proposals on
BitShares. Freelancers around the world that want to work for the BitShares DAC
are organized through our trusted escrow setup which carefully vets worker
proposals of freelancers, sets them up on the blockchain and ensures the
maximum of code quality for the BitShares shareholders.

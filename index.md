The BitShares Foundation is registered in Deventer, Netherlands. It is
operational since June 2016 and has been preparing industries behind the scenes
ever since. It is a pleasure to become more operational in the near future and
grow the BitShares ecosystem to its full potential.

# Transparent Communication

Decentralized networks come with a high need of cooperation and coordination.
To facilitate this need on a technical level, we provide open and transparent
mailing lists for 
* developers,
* block producers,
* committee members,
* shareholders, and
* projects running on top of BitShares.

# Escrow Workers

The BitShares Foundation takes a lead in managing worker proposals on
BitShares. Freelancers around the world that want to work for the BitShares DAC
are organized through our trusted escrow setup which carefully vets worker
proposals of freelancers, sets them up on the blockchain and ensures the
maximum of code quality for the BitShares shareholders.

Given that a worker may be voted in for quite some time, the BitShares
Foundation would like to exercise the new model of running a worker to reduce
risks and costs for the BitShares shareholders:

* BitShares Foundation has an account (`workers.bitshares.foundation`) that is co-owned by `committee-account` and escrow partners.
* The worker will redeem it's funds on a regular basis and buy up bitUSD from the market (with rational premiums).
* For this reasons and due to volatility of BTS, the actual pay of the worker is higher than the USD value.
* The worker will only pay the agreed amount of money and pay only in bitUSD to the `bitshares.foundation` account.
* Every BTS that is not paid out after the end of the worker will be returned to the BitShares shareholders through the reserve fund.

## Legal Setup

Workers listed on this site will be owned by the BitShares Foundation, who will
also act as the freelancer's contracting partner, supervise the progress and
facilitate payouts in bitUSD through a multi-signature escrow setup.

ChainSquad GmbH (@xeroc) has offered to handle the technical details, act as an
escrow and lead quality assurance procedures.

Additional partners of the BitShares Foundation may be added to the
multi-signature scheme to strengthen the quality protocols and add additional
expertise.

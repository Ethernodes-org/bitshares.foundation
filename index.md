# Tasks

## Transparent Communication

Decentralized networks come with a high need of cooperation and coordination.
To facilitate this need on a technical level, we provide open and transparent
mailing lists for developers, block producers, committee members and
shareholders.

[Go to the mailing lists](http://lists.bitshares.foundation)

## Escrow Workers

The BitShares Foundation takes a lead in managing worker proposals on
BitShares. Freelancers around the world that want to work for the BitShares DAC
are organized through our trusted escrow setup which carefully vets worker
proposals of freelancers, sets them up on the blockchain and ensures the
maximum of code quality for the BitShares shareholders.

### Workers by BitShares Foundation

Given that a worker will be voted in for quite some time, the BitShares
Foundation would like to exercise the new model of running a worker:

* BitShares Foundation has a LTM account (`workers.bitshares.foundation`) that is co-owned by `committee-account` and escrow partners
* The worker will redeem it's funds on a regular basis and buy up bitUSD from the market (with rational premiums)
* For this reasons and due to volatility of BTS, the actual pay of the worker is 2x the USD value
* The worker will only pay the agreed amount of money and pay only in bitUSD to `bitshares.foundation` account
* Every thing that is not paid out after the end of the worker will be settled and returned to the reserve fund

### Legal Setup

Workers listed on this page will be owned by the BitShares Foundation, who will
also act as the freelancer's contracting partner, supervise the progress and
facilitate payouts in bitUSD through a multi-signature escrow setup.

ChainSquad GmbH (@xeroc) has offered to handle the technical details, act as an
escrow and lead quality assurance procedures.

Next to ChainSquad GmbH, additional partners of the BitShares Foundation will
be added to the multi-signature scheme to strengthen the quality protocols and
add additional expertise.

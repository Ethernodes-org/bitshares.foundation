# Proposal

Given the growth of the BitShares ecosystem, we, [Blockchain Projects
BV](http://blockchainprojectsbv.com) see the urgent need to revise the
existing white papers and documentation of the whole BitShares platform.

From our recent business developments, we can confirm that regulators
are taking a closer look into the whole crypto ecosystem and they are
constantly confused due to unaligned use of terminology of old
economy, such as *assets*, *shareholders*, *equity*, *dividends*.

Unfortunately, our technical information is also "polluted" with
analysis in non-technical areas, such as bitassets and trading. As can
be found in the [second spokesperson
report](https://steemit.com/bitshares/@bitshares.fdn/second-report-spokesperson-bitshares-blockchain-foundation-on-bittrex-inc-and-other-regulatory-issues),
this requires an major rework.

Furthermore, the existing documentation hasn't been updated and reviewed
consistently. The majority of newcomers to the platform run into similar
issues which could be resolved by improved documentation and better
integration into the whole ecosystem (e.g. the reference wallet).

To ensure a proper and accurate representation of the BitShares
platform, major rework of existing material is required. The
documentation will not be reviewed by legal council as it has a purely
technical aim.

**Please note that this worker proposals focuses strongly on the technical
aspects of BitShares. Legal aspects need to be dealt with separately.**

It is our strong believe that it is required to separated the
**technical documentation** (such as RPC, blockchain APIs, etc.) from
the **functional and legal description** (such as the DEX, and
bitassets). This will help to distinguish BitShares (as a platform) from
the BTS token (as a cryptocurrency) and the services (such as the
exchange) offered through smart contracts.

# Revision of the Whitepapers

The whitepapers have been written almost 3 years ago. Not only did the
technology it describes improve, but also the understanding of legal
implications made by whitepapers has changed in 2017.

That said, we propose to revision the whitepapers to fit the current
needs to proper technical description with correct use of terminology to
accurately reflect the purpose of the platform.

# Milestones/Goals

1. Draft outline of content to be put into a series of whitepapers
2. General Overview Whitepaper
3. Whitepaper about the History of BitShares (the platform)
4. Whitepaper about the Technical Components of BitShares
5. Whitepaper about the Governance of BitShares
8. Technical description of the components of BitShares
   1. P2P network
   2. Consensus Mechanism DPOS
   3. Blockchain
   4. Authentication and Validation
   5. Transactions and Operations
   6. Hardened Smart Contracts
   7. Protocol Upgrades
   8. Account Management

The resulting documentation will be made public as can be used by
anyone, as well as on a domain owned by the BitShares Blockchain
Foundation (yet to be announced).

# Requirements

The documentation system will make use of
[Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org). The documentation itself must be
written in flawless English. A proper structuring of the content is
mandatory.

# Costs

Considering the amount of work still left together with the reworking of
existing material, it is very difficult to estimate the amount of time
needed. Thus, this worker proposals is a **billed worker** that pays
according to tracked time and will be invoiced accordingly at a rate of
$50 to $150/h depending on the background and technical education of the
individual working on this. Furthermore, parts of the work will be
available to be claimed by anyone knowledgable about the BitShares
technology as bounties.

This worker is **capped at $80,000** over a period of 12 months.
Whatever funds are not needed will be given back to the BitShares DAC.
Accounting will be delivered by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation and
made available to the public. Individual invoices received and paid by
the worker will be published as well.

# Key Performance Indicator (KPI)

All content created and paid for by this worker proposal will have to be
released under public domain or a comparable license. Thus, the content
will be freely available as soon as it is reviewed and approved.

# Remarks

* Terms & Conditions of BlockchainProjects BV applies with the BitShares
  DAC being referred to as `Client`. The Terms & Conditions are deemed
  accepted as soon as the on-chain proposal has been approved by the BTS
  holders.

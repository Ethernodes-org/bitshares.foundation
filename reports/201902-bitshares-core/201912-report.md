This is an intermediate report for the [2019 BitShares Core Worker proposal](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-02-bitshares-core).

# Work Delivered So Far

This section is meant to provide a brief overview highlighting specific tasks completed and features delivered. More complete information is available in [GitHub](https://github.com/bitshares/) repositories, in the [release notes](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/releases) as well as in our documentation websites:
* [how.bitshares.works](https://how.bitshares.works/)
* [dev.bitshares.works](https://dev.bitshares.works/)

Typically, each release was preceded by one or more testnet releases not listed here. The core team wishes to thank all who helped with testing, in particular the testnet block producers.

In addition, the core team has on several occasions produced block producer-only softfork releases as a short-term measure against security vulnerabilities, many of which originated from [Hack the DEX](https://hackthedex.io).

## Feature Highlights

The following is a (somewhat arbitrary) selection of "interesting" features that were implemented during 2019.
These map generally to our stated [Development Initiatives within the worker proposal](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-02-bitshares-core).
An update to this roadmap visualizing the progress can be seen below

![BitShares Core Initiatives - Update 2019](/reports/201902-bitshares-core/2019_Roadmap_updated.png)

In total, the GitHub [bitshares-core](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core) repository alone shows 256 issues and 351 pull requests closed, plus various more in the [`fc`](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-fc) and documentation repositories (as of 2019-11-13).

### Performance Improvements

Every planned release included optimizations and code refactors to enable faster processing power. This is something that node operators will benefit from more than end users.

Particular changes include

* Cryptographic processing has been parallelized which enables much faster validation during synching
* Support for native 128-bit calculations
* Market engine improvements

### API Improvements

Various improvements to the core API have been implemented on request by, and in collaboration with, the BitShares UI team.

Among others there were:
 - performance improvements to account discovery by means of public keys (circumventing attack vectors to effectively render accounts unusable in the UI by connecting it to hundreds of other accounts)
 - extension to the subscription system by allowing a more fine-tuned control (direct benefit for node operators to reduce CPU and traffic)
 - ability to lazy load account connected objects (direct performance benefit to any UI)


### Hash-Timelocked Contracts (HTLC)

With Hash-Timelocked Contracts (aka conditional transfers) as specified in [BSIP-44](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0044.md)
there exist now now means to perform atomic cross-chain swaps with other blockchains that support it (which includes Bitcoin and mosts of its derivatives).

### Market-Fee Referral Program

As specified in [BSIP-43](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0043.md), asset owners can now redistribute part of their market fees to the referral program.

### Custom Active Authorities

The upcoming protocol release version 4.0.0 will include the implementation of [BSIP-40](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0040.md).

BSIP-40 allows an account to extend control over specific operations to other authorities (i. e. keys or accounts).
Examples for this could be using a separate key for publishing price feeds, or using a separate key for a trading bot.

### Hardware Wallet Support

BitShares support for the Ledger Nano S hardware wallet has been implemented. The [code](https://github.com/bitshares/ledger-app-bitshares) is complete and currently being submitted to Ledger for inclusion in their [Ledger Live](https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live) app.

### Technical Debt

The codebase has seen several updates to improve compatibility with newer environments. This includes

* Support for Boost library versions up to 1.69
* Move to C++-14 standard
* Replace many `fc`-provided primitives with equivalent `std` functionality
* Upgrades to the build system (CMake)

### Decentralized Build

The codebase now supports building with [Gitian](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-gitian).
This means verifiably untampered binaries of the core software can be provided with each release. Find our listing on the [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/who/) site.

### BitShares Improvement Proposals (BSIPs)

As per the [worker proposal](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2019-02-bitshares-core), the core team has taken on an active role in managing the BSIP process. Various BSIPs have been created, discussed and refined with support from the community.

The following BSIPs have been completed and are currently [up for vote](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=29720.0). In order to bridge the language gap between the eastern and western parts of our community, several BSIPs have been translated into Chinese. An overview with short description for each BSIP is also [available here](https://www.bitshares.foundation/announcements/2019-10-21-new-bsips).

* [BSIP-22](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0022.md) Vote Decay
* [BSIP-39](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0039.md) Optionally Auto-Approve Proposals
* [BSIP-45](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0045.md) Add BitAsset Backing as Collateral Flag
* [BSIP-47](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0047.md) Vote-Proxy Categories and Explicit Voting Operation
* [BSIP-57](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0057.md) Managed Vesting Balances
* [BSIP-61](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0061.md) Operation to Update Limit Orders
* [BSIP-62](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0062.md) Close Margin Position
* [BSIP-64](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0064.md) ([CN](https://bihu.com/article/1600586531)) Optional HTLC Preimage-Length and Hashes
* [BSIP-69](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0069.md) Additional Assert Predicates
* [BSIP-70](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0070.md) ([CN](https://bihu.com/article/1997912434)) P2P Leveraged Trading
* [BSIP-72](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0072.md) ([CN](https://bihu.com/article/1376117086)) Tanks &amp; Taps: Smart Contract Asset Handling
* [BSIP-73](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0073.md) ([CN](https://bihu.com/article/1403238012)) Match Forced-Settlement Orders Best-Price

In addition, several *Informational* BSIPs were completed as well. These do not require voting.

* [BSIP-58](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0058.md) Global-Settlement Protection Through Price Feeding
* [BSIP-59](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0059.md) Adjustment of MSSR and MCR Through Voting
* [BSIP-60](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0060.md) BitShares URI scheme
* [BSIP-63](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0063.md) Short-Lived Unidirectional Payment Channels

Many more BSIPs are still in various states of preparation and/or review.

#### Repository Access Restricted

On 25 OCT 2019, most core team members had their write access removed from the BSIP repository by a single community member.
This action halted efforts to continue the work on improvement proposals to polish them for community voting.
This was done due to conflicts arising through the efforts of drafting the BSIP
[Decouple BitAssets from Platform Governance Process](https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/pull/249).
Authors of this draft are also members of the core team, however this is NOT an initiative coming from the core team as a community-paid worker.
Any and all efforts were done voluntary and unpaid.

## Emergency Fix

On [2019-09-05T12:39Z](http://cryptofresh.com/b/40703275) the [chain came to a halt](https://www.bitshares.foundation/announcements/2019-09-05-bitshares-incident-halted-chain). The core team was able to identify the bug and provide a fixed version within one hour. Block production resumed at [2019-09-05T13:40Z](http://cryptofresh.com/b/40703276).

This corresponds to an uptime of 99.98%, measured from Jan 1 until Nov 13.

The core team wishes to thank the block producers for their responsiveness and assistance in getting the chain running again.

## Documentation
The core team is actively updating the existing documentation with regard to functionality changed by core modifications. In addition, several conceptual parts of the documentation websites were updated:
Developer documentation about [public](https://dev.bitshares.works/en/master/development/testnets/public_testnet.html) and [private](https://dev.bitshares.works/en/master/development/testnets/private_testnet-v2.html) testnets, e. g.
[Config file](https://dev.bitshares.works/en/master/development/apps/node_config_example.html#parameters) documentation
[Key generation](https://dev.bitshares.works/en/master/bts_guide/tutorials/how_to_get_key_pairs.html#how-to-get-key-pairs)
[Genesis file](https://dev.bitshares.works/en/master/development/testnets/private_testnet_genesis_example.html#private-testnet-genesis-example) documentation
[cli_wallet](https://dev.bitshares.works/en/master/bts_guide/tutorials/cli_wallet_setpwd_unlock.html#cli-wallet-setpwd-unlock) functionality

# Future

## Protocol Upgrade 4.0.0

The next [Protocol Release version 4.0.0](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/projects/15) was planned to be activated on 18 DEC 2019. During the
testnet deployment of that release bugs were found and fixed that caused a delay in the release to mainnet. The core worker has strict quality assurance rules,
one of them is to announce a mainnet release 4 weeks in advance to allow all node and witness operators to upgrade their nodes. This premise pushes the final
publication of release 4.0.0 out of scope of this worker and as such, no release date can be announced.

## Funding

The current worker proposal expires on 29 DEC 2019. Funding for the core worker `1.14.163` was
"[fully funded](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=28573.msg332020#msg332020)" due to BTS price peaking in July and requested suspension of votes to allow
other workers to be funded. However,  BTS price continued dropping and the remaining funds will not suffice to fund the level of effort delivered in the past
during the remaining weeks.

     In consequence, we would like to ask all BTS holders to vote the core worker 1.14.163 up again.

## Roadmap

An  updated roadmap was presented above. This worker is expiring end of 2019, thus presenting a roadmap for 2020 is not feasible, also due to recent events.

The core team has finished a number of BSIPs that are currently up for voting (see BSIPs above).
None of the improvement proposals have been approved by the BTS holders yet. Those BSIPs, if approved,
would certainly be part of a roadmap for 2020. Any partial work already done here was delivered on a voluntary basis.

Current efforts center around cleaning up repositories, test suites, and minor issues that have been building up over time.
We hope that leaving a clean codebase behind will facilitate future worker teams getting themselves acquainted with it should
the existing core team not receive funding in the future.
